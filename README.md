# Heart-Rate-Monitor
The vital sensing device will be capable of detecting the body temperature and heart rate based on input from the user. The device will harness sensors such as the TMP36, which the user will place their finger on as means to calculate their body temperature. Additionally, a pulse sensor will be utilized to detect the beats per minute of the userâ€™s finger or alternatively their ear. This device will fundamentally present the user their vitals with relatively cheap equipment. There has also been the addition to an LED to signify when the users heart beats as well as an LCD to project the results. Other specified parts which are not critical to the key use of the project will allow the device to operate efficient and effectively. Parts such as those encompassing the LCD and pushbuttons will aid in the process of presenting the results. In conjunction to this, the code will also aid in the process of interconnecting the hardware components and may display the results on the serial monitor.
